# Catpedia
A cattastic Android app about our furry friends

Android app written in Kotlin showcasing the usage of Dagger 2, Navigation components, ViewModel, LiveData, databinding, viewbinding, Retrofit 2 and RxJava 3 with the help of Glide image library.

You can browse through a list of cat breeds that is fetched using a REST API to find more info about them.
The list can be filtered by the cat's country of origin.

The Login page is mocked, so you need to use as user name/password: Pumpkin/catnip.

# The given problem is:

Catgrats on joing the CATganisation!

Cats need your help , we want to build an app where everyone can login and see beautiful cats , because they are so amazing.

For the login part, our backend is not yet ready , so you will need to mock the backend responses , and do a "local" login untill the backend is ready.

But don't worry and try to be as close as possible to the final implementation. Whatever you define as requests and responses , we will mimick what you've done in the final implemntation of the backend.

And now to the furry part.

To get the info you need about cats please get familiar with https://docs.thecatapi.com/

When our catstomers enter our app , we want that they see an alphabetical ordered list of all the cat breeds that are available. Customers should be able to filter the breeds by country.

Each cat breed will be shown in a "card" with a small image on the left side, and the name and description of the cat breed in the rest of the card.

When a card is tapped , we will show a details page , where we will put the image, the name , description , country code , the temperament and wikipedia link of the particular breed.
