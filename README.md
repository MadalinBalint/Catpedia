# Catpedia
A cattastic Android app about our furry friends

Android app written in Kotlin showcasing the usage of ViewModel, LiveData, data binding, Retrofit and coroutines with the help of Glide image library.
You can browse through a list of cat breeds that is fetched using a REST API to find more info about them.
The list can be filtered by the cat's country of origin.

The Login page is mocked, so you need to use as user name/password: Pumpkin/catnip.
